      <h1>Short Bio</h1>
        <p>Hey everyone, my name is Cooper, and I'd like to tell you a little about myself. I was born in Florida, but I spent most of my childhood in two very different places: Staten Island in New York and the beautiful countryside of Pennsylvania. My career as an air traffic controller with the FAA has taken me all over the country, from Oklahoma City and Memphis to my current home in Alaska.</p>
        <p>When I'm not working, I love to get out on my motorcycle or hit the trails on my mountain bike. I'm also a big fan of gaming, whether it's playing video games or tabletop RPGs like Pathfinder and D&amp;D with my step-brother.</p>
        <p>My house has been taken over by my three sled dogs, Hanzo and Sombra - siblings from the same litter and our adoptee, Misty. We stay active together, and one of our favorite things is Bikejoring. If you're not familiar, it's a sport where the dogs pull someone riding a bike - it's a great workout especially through trails in the woods.</p>
        <p>As much as I like Alaska, I do miss some aspects of my previous homes, especially the food trucks in Memphis and Oklahoma City. Fairbanks just doesn't have the same variety when it comes to food and entertainment options. Though Alaska is a great place for my other hobby which is long range shooting. I served as a designated marksman in the army, and now I teach long-range shooting as a side job and compete in long-range competitions whenever I get the chance.</p>
