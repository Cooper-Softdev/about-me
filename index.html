          <h1>Short Bio</h1>
          <p>Hey everyone, my name is Cooper, and I'd like to tell you a little about myself. I was born in Florida, but
            I spent most of my childhood in two very different places: Staten Island in New York and the beautiful
            countryside of Pennsylvania. My career as an air traffic controller with the FAA has taken me all over the
            country, from Oklahoma City and Memphis to my current home in Alaska.</p>
          <p>When I'm not working, I love to get out on my motorcycle or hit the trails on my mountain bike. I'm also a
            big fan of gaming, whether it's playing video games or tabletop RPGs like Pathfinder and D&amp;D with my
            step-brother.</p>
          <p>My house has been taken over by my three sled dogs, Hanzo and Sombra - siblings from the same litter and
            our adoptee, Misty. We stay active together, and one of our favorite things is Bikejoring. If you're not
            familiar, it's a sport where dogs pull someone riding a bike - it's a great workout especially through
            trails.</p>
          <p>As much as I like Alaska, I do miss the "smaller 48", especially the food trucks in Memphis and Oklahoma
            City. Fairbanks just doesn't have the same variety when it comes to food and entertainment options, place is
            kinda eh. Although Alaska is a great place for my other hobby which is long range shooting. I was a
            designated marksman in the army, and I teach long-range shooting as a side job and compete in long-range
            competitions whenever I get the chance.</p>
