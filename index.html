      <h1>Short Bio</h1>
        <p>My name is Dylan Cooper, and I grew up in Staten Island and Pennsylvania.<br>
          After graduating high school, I joined the Army to become an Air Traffic Controller.<br>
          I served in the Army for 8 years before transitioning to the same role with the FAA.
        </p>
        <p>During my time with the FAA, I worked in three different locations: Oklahoma City, Memphis, and Alaska.<br>
          All of these assignments taught me valuable skills in communication, teamwork, and critical thinking.<br>
          While I enjoyed the work, I've always had a passion for software development and coding.
        </p>
        <p>That's why I'm now pursuing a career in software development.<br>
          I'm currently taking courses and working on personal projects to build my skills and experience.<br>
          My goal is to become a skilled software developer and contribute to meaningful projects.
        </p>
